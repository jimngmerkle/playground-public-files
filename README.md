Bloomreach-provided example mobile apps integrated with Merkle sandbox

Android version 
https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/android-sdk-example-app
BLOOMREACH-SAMPLE-ANDROID-FIREBASE-V102.apk
- has Firebase integration for push notifications

iOS version 
https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/ios-sdk-example-app
BLOOMREACH-SAMPLE-APP-iOS.ipa
- only works via testing platforms like browserstack as I am not enrolled in the Apple Developer Program necessary for signing iOS apps. No push notification functionality either as they
rely on the Apple Push Notification service, which requires a valid APNs certificate. These certificates can only be generated through the Apple Developer Program 99 USD a year :/
